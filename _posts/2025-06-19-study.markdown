# 1. nonlocal
```python
def non_local_test():
    number = 0
    # nonlocal keyword is used to declare a variable as non-local, like parsing the variable from the inner scope to the outer scope
    def change_num():
        nonlocal number
        number = 100
        print("this is nonlocal variable in local scope",number) # print 100

    change_num()

    print("this is nonlocal variable in non-local scope",number) # print 100

non_local_test()

def different_local_test():
    number = 0

    def change_num():
        number = 100
        print("this is local variable in local scope",number) # print 100

    change_num()

    print("this is local variable in non-local scope",number) # print 0

different_local_test()
```

# 2. \_\_call__ method
```python
# __call__ method is instance make callable like function
class Callable:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {self.name=} with args: {args=} and kwargs: {kwargs=}")

callable = Callable("test")
callable(1,2,3, a=1, b=2)

# return : Calling self.name='test' with args: (1, 2, 3) and kwargs: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```
# 3. FastAPI Structure Summary

## 3-1. ASGI Server and FastAPI Connection

* **ASGI servers** like Uvicorn invoke the FastAPI **ASGI app** with
  `await app(scope, receive, send)`
* `app` refers to the **middleware-wrapped FastAPI instance**

## 3-2. ASGI's Three Components

| Component | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope`   | Request metadata (HTTP method, path, headers, etc.)  |
| `receive` | Async function to receive request body chunks        |
| `send`    | Async function to send response chunks to the client |

---

## 3-3. FastAPI Middleware Wrapping Structure

* `app.add_middleware()` wraps the internal `router` with middleware layers
* The **last-added middleware** becomes the **outermost** wrapper
  (I think similar to the **React Provider pattern**)

```
ThirdMiddleware(
    SecondMiddleware(
        FirstMiddleware(
            Router
        )
    )
)
```

## 3-4. Request and Response Flow

### Request Flow (outer → inner)

```
ASGI Server (Uvicorn)
  ↓
FastAPI.__call__
  ↓
ThirdMiddleware → dispatch() → call_next()
  ↓
SecondMiddleware → dispatch() → call_next()
  ↓
FirstMiddleware → dispatch() → call_next()
  ↓
Router → endpoint execution
```

### Response Flow (inner → outer)

```
Endpoint returns a Response
  ↑
FirstMiddleware → post-processing
  ↑
SecondMiddleware → post-processing
  ↑
ThirdMiddleware → post-processing
  ↑
FastAPI returns to ASGI Server → response sent to client
```
